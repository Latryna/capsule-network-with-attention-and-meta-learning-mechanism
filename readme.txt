Idea for a neural network architecture that processes raw sensory data in a way similar to human cognitive mechanics, using empty capsules and a guided meta-learning engine to interpret complex inputs such as text from images, without relying on pre-existing text data.

Unlike Generative Trained Transformers. The weights in my network are dynamic, needed for re-evaluation of the persistent memory process. When it learns to interpret raw sensory data from analog sources — sound, image, and touch — it does not “predict,” but learns sensory language by “learning to read from an image” with the support of authoritative models. The network mimics the cognitive development of a newborn, learning to interpret raw unstructured data and what to store it. This is not a problem at first, because the capsules are empty. I use IPFS and they have a cool algorithm, I modified it for my network to dynamically capture regression-style data from the meta-learning engine’s feature stream. The algorithm writes to labeled capsules data of the unrewarded modality or those that the cognitive instance did not recognize from the modality. The authoritative network and the teacher instances review, compare, classify, optimize this data and use it as guided meta-learning. Only high-quality data remains in the capsule. Weights are calculated as association data for future re-evaluations. Sometimes it leaves literally decimal bits as vector data.

Key Components:

Sensory Modality Processing:

Data Acquisition: Use sensors to capture raw sensory data (e.g., microphones for auditory noise, voltage sensors for electrical signals).

Preprocessing: Convert analog signals to digital form through sampling, filtering, and normalization.

Empty Capsules Architecture:

Initial State: Start with capsules devoid of predefined knowledge, allowing the network to learn representations from scratch.

Hierarchical Learning: Implement a deep hierarchy of capsules to capture increasingly complex features from raw data.

Guided Learning Mechanism:

Reinforcement Learning: Provide feedback or rewards for correct interpretations, guiding the network towards desirable behaviors.

Self-Supervised Learning: Enable the network to learn by predicting parts of its input or reconstructing it.

Meta-Learning Integration:

Adaptive Learning: Allow the network to adapt its learning strategies based on encountered tasks.
